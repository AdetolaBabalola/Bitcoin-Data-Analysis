### Comprehensive Report on Bitcoin Data Analysis Using Power BI Dashboard

**Introduction:**
This report provides an analysis of Bitcoin data using insights derived from a Power BI dashboard. The dashboard visualizes several key metrics such as yearly and monthly variations in Bitcoin volume, the weighted price of Bitcoin, and how these trends have evolved over time. The aim is to understand the dynamics of Bitcoin’s performance in terms of price and transaction volume across various years and months.

### 1. **Yearly Variation of Bitcoin Volume (Currency):**
The volume of Bitcoin traded each year shows significant fluctuations:
- **2012:** 23 billion
- **2014:** 31 billion
- **2016:** 22 billion
- **2018:** 35 billion
- **2020:** 33 billion

The volume peaked in **2018** at **35 billion** before declining slightly to **33 billion** in **2020**. The earlier years show lower volumes, reflecting the gradual adoption of Bitcoin before a surge in trading activity during 2018【24†source】.

### 2. **Yearly Variation of Bitcoin (BTC):**
The number of Bitcoins traded each year has also seen notable variations:
- **2012:** 0.9 million BTC
- **2014:** 5.5 million BTC
- **2016:** 3.0 million BTC
- **2018:** 5.0 million BTC
- **2020:** 4.7 million BTC

The year **2014** saw the highest volume of Bitcoin transactions with **5.5 million BTC**, followed closely by **2018** at **5.0 million BTC**. After that, the volume slightly declined to **4.7 million BTC** in 2020【24†source】.

### 3. **Monthly Variation of Weighted Price:**
The monthly variation of Bitcoin’s weighted price shows considerable changes across the year:
- **January:** 2.7 billion
- **February:** 2.2 billion
- **March:** 3.3 billion
- **April:** 0.9 billion
- **May:** 1.3 billion
- **June:** 1.5 billion
- **July:** 1.2 billion
- **August:** 1.7 billion
- **September:** 2.8 billion
- **October:** 1.2 billion
- **November:** 1.3 billion
- **December:** 1.4 billion

**March** shows the highest weighted price at **3.3 billion**, while **April** registers the lowest price at **0.9 billion**. This sharp drop in April followed by a gradual recovery reflects periods of high volatility in the Bitcoin market【24†source】.

### 4. **Yearly Variation of Weighted Price:**
Analyzing the yearly variation of the weighted price shows a similar pattern to the volume data:
- **2012:** 0.1 billion
- **2014:** 5.7 billion
- **2016:** 3.8 billion
- **2018:** 5.8 billion
- **2020:** 4.0 billion

**2018** recorded the highest weighted price at **5.8 billion**, which coincides with Bitcoin's boom period, followed by a slight decrease to **4.0 billion** in **2020**. The earlier years, such as **2012**, saw relatively low prices as Bitcoin was still in its early stages of adoption【24†source】.

### 5. **Weighted Price and Volume (Currency) Per Year:**
This analysis highlights the relationship between Bitcoin's weighted price and trading volume over the years:
- **2012:** 23 billion in volume with 0.1 billion weighted price
- **2014:** 31 billion in volume with 5.7 billion weighted price
- **2016:** 22 billion in volume with 3.8 billion weighted price
- **2018:** 35 billion in volume with 5.8 billion weighted price
- **2020:** 33 billion in volume with 4.0 billion weighted price

There is a clear correlation between the increase in Bitcoin trading volume and the rise in weighted price. Notably, the peak in both volume and price occurred in **2018**, driven by a significant rise in interest in Bitcoin during that year【24†source】.

---

### Conclusion:
The analysis of Bitcoin data over the years highlights several key trends:
- **2018** stands out as the peak year for both Bitcoin trading volume and price, marking a high point in market activity.
- The data also reveals that despite some fluctuations, Bitcoin’s trading volume and price have maintained a high level of activity, particularly after 2014.
- **March** typically exhibits the highest monthly variation in price, while **April** shows the lowest, indicating periods of volatility during the year.

These insights can help investors, analysts, and stakeholders understand the historical trends in Bitcoin's trading behavior, offering valuable information for decision-making in future investments and market predictions.
